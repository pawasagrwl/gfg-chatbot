# Project Name: AI-Based FAQ Chatbot for GeeksforGeeks

## Project Description:

Develop an AI chatbot that answers frequently asked questions (FAQs) about coding problems, tutorials, or general inquiries about GeeksforGeeks. This chatbot could be integrated into the existing GeeksforGeeks website.

## Features and Components:

Frontend Chat Interface: This would be the chat window that users interact with. You can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive chat interface that's embedded on the GeeksforGeeks website.

Backend Server: This is where the chatbot logic resides. It receives user inputs from the frontend, processes them, and sends back responses. You could use Node.js and Express.js for this.

Database: You would need a database to store FAQs and their answers. MongoDB or PostgreSQL could be used for this purpose.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) Model: The AI component of the project. You can use libraries such as spaCy or NLTK for text processing, and a machine learning library (like TensorFlow or PyTorch) to train a model that can understand user queries and fetch appropriate responses from the database.

## Learning Outcomes:

In this project, students would learn the basics of full-stack development including frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), backend (Node.js, Express.js), and database management (MongoDB or PostgreSQL). They would also gain hands-on experience with AI by implementing a basic NLP model.
